# RPS-Game
This project was submitted to Udacity during their Intro to Programming Nanodegree course. It is a text-based rock, paper, scissors game in Python, in which a human player can play against a RandomPlayer, ReflectPlayer and a CyclePlayer best two out of three. You can play as many times as you like before ending the program.
